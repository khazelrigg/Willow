[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/khazelrigg/wordCount.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/khazelrigg/wordCount)

**Word Count** is a Java application built using Stanford's Core NLP library with the main purpose 
of analysing a file to generate parts of speech distribution charts.

---

### Usage:
WordCount is best run through the command line using the WordCount class as the current JavaFX 
application is currently missing lots of functionality.

To run this program:
    
1. Get the [latest release](https://github.com/khazelrigg/wordCount/releases)

2. Execute

     In the terminal execute:
    
        java -jar wordCount.jar
   

3. Input the path to a file or directory of files
4. Find results in the results directory created in the working directory
