Word Count
==========

**Word Count** is a Java application built using Stanford's Core NLP library with the main purpose 
of analysing a file to generate parts of speech distribution charts.

---

### Usage:
WordCount is best run through the command line using the WordCount class as the current JavaFX 
application is currently missing lots of functionality.
